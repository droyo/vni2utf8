vni2utf8 is a small utility that translates ascii text into utf8
text according to the rules of the vni input method. It reads ascii
text on standard input, and outputs utf8 text on standard output.
Characters containing diacritics are represented by their precomposed
unicode equivalents (not a combination of composition characters).

There are two classes of diacritics in vietnamese; tone markers,
and accents. In VNI input mode, they are represented as follows:

TONES
1: dấu sắc (rising tone)
2: dấu huyền (falling tone)
3: dấu hỏi (dipping tone)
4: dấu ngã (glottal rising)
5: dấu nặng (glottal falling)

ACCENTS
6: hat or caret (^)
7: horn (in ơ and ư)
8: moon (˘)
9: bar (in đ)

The class of the diacritic playes a role in where you can put it.
You can type the number for a tone anywhere inside or after a word,
but an accent must come after the letter it is written over
(disregarding tones). Some examples:

tru7o7ng1 → trướng
tru17o7ng → trướng
g2io7 → gìơ
ye6n → yên
yen6 → yen6

I wrote this tool so I could type Vietnamese in environments where I
don't have any heavyweight input methods available.  It also works
very well with plan9 tools like Acme and sam, which do not work with
X11 input methods.  This should compile for plan9 if you change the
mkfile a little bit.  I use this application on FreeBSD 64-bit.  If
you have trouble compiling it, let me know.
