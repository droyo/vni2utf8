     vni2utf8(1)                                           vni2utf8(1)





     NAME
          vni2utf8 - convert vni ascii text to Vietnamese utf8

     SYNOPSIS
          vni2utf8

     DESCRIPTION
          Vni2utf8 accepts a stream of vni-encoded ascii text on stan-
          dard input, and prints to standard output a stream of utf8-
          encoded Vietnamese characters. Input is broken up into words
          separated by non-alphanumeric characters. Each number in a
          word represents a different diacritic.

          Diacritics 1-5 are placed over the final vowel of the word,
          or the penultimate vowel if the word ends in a vowel, and
          can be typed anywhere within the word itself.

          Diacritics 6-9 are placed over the preceding character. If a
          diacritic is not valid in a given word or character, the
          number is copied verbatim to standard output.  The diacrit-
          ics are ordered as follows:

          1    Rising tone (´) as in cá (fish)

          2    Falling tone (`) as in gà (chicken)

          3    Question tone (ˀ) as in hỏi (ask)

          4    Glottal break (~) as in kỹ (technical)

          5    Heavy tone (.) as in xạo (unreliable)

          6    Circumflex (^) as in cô (aunt)

          7    Horn ( ̓) as in khơ (difficult)

          8    Breve (˘) as in năm (year)

          9    Bar (-) as in đi (go)
